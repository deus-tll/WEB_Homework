    <h2 class="headers">What is HTML?</h2>

    <p>
      <span class="bold-text">Hypertext Markup Language (<span class="dashed-text">HTML</span>)</span> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      Web browsers receive <span class="dashed-text">HTML</span> documents from a web server or from local storage and render 
      the documents into multimedia web pages. <span class="dashed-text">HTML</span> describes the structure of a web page 
      semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="dashed-text">HTML</span> elements are the building blocks of <span class="dashed-text">HTML</span> pages. With <span class="dashed-text">HTML</span> constructs, images and other 
      objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
      <span class="dashed-text">HTML</span> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics 
      for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. 
      <span class="dashed-text">HTML</span> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. 
      Tags such as <span class="tags-in-text">&lt;img /&gt;</span> and <span class="tags-in-text">&lt;input /&gt;</span> directly introduce content into the page. 
      Other tags such as <span class="tags-in-text">&lt;p&gt;</span> surround and provide information about document text 
      and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the <span class="dashed-text">HTML</span> 
      tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
    </p>

    <h2 class="headers">Markup</h2>

    <p>
      HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), 
      character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly 
      come in pairs like <span class="tags-in-text">&lt;h1&gt;</span> and <span class="tags-in-text">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, 
      for example <span class="tags-in-text">&lt;img&gt;</span>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag 
      (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
    </p>

    <p>
      Another important component is the <span class="dashed-text">HTML</span> document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:
    </p>

    <pre>
      <span class="tags-in-text">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
      &lt;html&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;
              &lt;title&gt;</span>This is a title<span class="tags-in-text">&lt;/title&gt;
          &lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;body&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;</span>Hello world!<span class="tags-in-text">&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;</span>
    </pre>
