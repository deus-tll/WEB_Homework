        <h2>William Shakespeare</h2>

        <hr>

        <p class="small-text">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>

        <p>
          William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 - 23 April 1616) was an
          English poet,
          playwright and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the
          English
          language and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called
          England's
          national poet and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including
          collaborations,
          consist of approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative
          poems,
          and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have
          been
          translated into every major living language and are performed more
          often
          than those of any other playwright.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire.
          At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three
          children:
          Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592,
          he
          began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and
          part-owner of
          a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as
          the King's Men.
          At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford,
          where he
          died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life
          survive;
          this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his
          physical
          appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the
          works attributed
          to him were written by others. Such theories are often criticised for
          failing to
          adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the
          period.

          Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613.
          His early plays
          were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the
          best work
          produced in these genres. Until about 1608, he wrote mainly tragedies,
          among them Hamlet,
          Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest
          works in the English
          language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also
          known as romances)
          and collaborated with other playwrights.

          Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying
          quality and accuracy in
          his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of
          Shakespeare's,
          John Heminges and Henry Condell, published a more definitive text
          known as the First Folio,
          a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that
          included all but two of
          his plays. The volume was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which
          Jonson presciently hails
          Shakespeare in a now-famous quote as "not of an age, but for all time".

        <p>
          Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare's works have been
          continually
          adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and
          performance.
          His plays remain popular and are studied, performed, and reinterpreted
          through
          various cultural and political contexts around the world.
