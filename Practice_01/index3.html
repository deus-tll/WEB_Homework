        <h3>Linear Equations</h3>
        <div>
            <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>

            <div>ax + b = 0</div>

            <p>
                where <span>a</span> and <span>b</span> are real numbers and <span>x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard 
                form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. 
                Also, the variable may or may not be an <span>x</span> so don't get too locked into always seeing an <span>x</span> there.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Quadratic Equation</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:
            </p>

            <div>ax<span class="square"><sup>2</sup></span> + bx + c = 0</div>

            <p>
                where <span>a</span>, <span>b</span>, <span>c</span> are known values and <span>x</span> is the variable or unknown 
                (we don't know it yet). Also, <span>a</span> can't be 0.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>The area of a circle (A)</h3>
        <div>
            <p><span>&pi;</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span>r</span>) squared:</p>
            
            <div>A = &pi; &#215; r<span class="square"><sup>2</sup></span></div>

            <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span>D</span>):</p>

            <div>A = (&pi; / 4) &#215; D<span class="square"><sup>2</sup></span></div>

            <p>or, when you know the circumference (<span>C</span>):</p>

            <div>A = C<span class="square"><sup>2</sup></span> / 4 &#215; &pi;</div>
        </div>

        <h3>Intersection</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                The intersection of two sets <span>A</span> and <span>B</span>, denoted by A &#8745; B, is the set of 
                all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,
            </p>

            <div>A &#8712; B = { x : x &#8712; A and x &#8712; B }</div>

            <p>
                That is, <span>x</span> is an element of the intersection A &#8745; B if and only 
                if <span>x</span> is both an element of <span>A</span> and an element of <span>B</span>.
            </p>
        </div>
