        <h1>Vehicle</h1>
        <p>
            A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<sup><span>[1]</span></sup>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons, 
            bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, 
            boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and 
            spacecraft.<sup><span>[2]</span></sup>

            Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground: 
            wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for 
            road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<sup><span>[3]</span></sup>
